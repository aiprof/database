## Academic Misconduct
All acts of academic dishonesty including cheating and plagiarism will be viewed as violations of appropriate student conduct and they will be dealt with following student due process policies in effect. Disciplinary actions will be taken as warranted. An act of academic dishonesty in this course will automatically result in a grade of F on the test or assignment at issue, and possibly for the course itself. Please, give credit where credit is due, specifically and consistently. The appropriate use of technology is expected. Please refer to the material posted on the WSU website regarding academic integrity and acceptable student conduct and appropriate use of technology resources. The following website provides clarification and examples of the behaviors that are prohibited (https://doso.wayne.edu/conduct/academic-misconduct).

Strict compliance with the Wayne State University Academic Integrity policies and the Student Code of Conduct are required in this course. Any cheating (including collaboration among students on quizzes or exams), fabrication, plagiarism, or other academic dishonesty may result in an automatic failing grade for this entire course, irrespective of the specific context or assessment involved (quiz, research paper, exam, etc.). Also, charges may be filed with the Judicial Officer of the Dean of Students Office. For more information, see the Student Code of Conduct brochure. There is zero tolerance for academic dishonesty in this course.

In this regard, please be advised that written assignments, such as essay exam answers, papers, and other submissions, may be submitted to SafeAssign/Uni-check software (or similar software or services) for an evaluation of the originality of your work, for assurance that these assignments contain no plagiarism, and for proper attribution of published sources, and may be included in the restricted databases of providers such as SafeAssign/Uni-check, solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. Plagiarism is a form of cheating and, consistent with the University’s Student Code of Conduct and our School’s Code of Ethics evidence of plagiarism in written assignments, or evidence of other violations, are grounds for further disciplinary action.

For more information of academic integrity, see the following book:

Lipson, C. Doing honest work in college: how to prepare citations, avoid plagiarism, and achieve academic success, Chicago, 2004.
